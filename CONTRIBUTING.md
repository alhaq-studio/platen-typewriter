# Contributing to Platen: 3D Typewriter

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Platen: 3D Typewriter**! We warmly welcome contributions from developers, 3D artists, typographers, sound engineers, and mechanical history enthusiasts to help build the world's most authentic, photorealistic, and mechanically faithful digital typewriter.

## The Vision & Manifesto

> *"Write to hold, own and carry."*  
> *"No algorithms, no autocomplete—just ink, steel, and intention. Crafted for the weight of genuine writing."*

Our mission is to preserve and elevate the tactile poetry, mechanical precision, and distraction-free beauty of analog typewriting in the digital age. Every typebar, escapement tooth, stamped keylever, and acoustic resonance is crafted with physical fidelity and zero-knowledge privacy in mind.

## Procedural 3D & Mechanical Kinematics Guidelines

1. **Procedural First**: All mechanical parts (typebars, keylevers, segment casting, escapement wheels, paper bail, ribbon spools) are procedurally modeled using Three.js geometry primitives and parametric curves to ensure lightweight bundles and runtime customizability.
2. **Physical Kinematic Accuracy**:
   - Strike arcs follow real mechanical fulcrum centers.
   - Escapement carriage advancement is stepped per character pitch.
   - Keylevers depress along accurate angular pivots with spring recovery.
3. **PBR Material Standards**:
   - Use curated PBR materials (`castIron`, `wrinkleEnamel`, `nickel`, `bakelite`, `vulcanizedRubber`).
   - Keep surface roughness, metalness, and subtle procedural normal maps balanced for high realism.

---

## Acoustic Sound Design Guidelines

1. All sound effects are generated 100% procedurally on-device using the **Web Audio API** (`src/audio/MechanicalAudio.ts`).
2. Acoustic profiles include:
   - Variable frequency response based on key lever length and distance from center.
   - Dynamic velocity scaling for hard vs soft typing.
   - Platen rubber acoustic absorption and hollow metal chassis cavity resonance.

---

## Zero-Knowledge Privacy Standard

Platen is committed to absolute user privacy:
- **100% Local Execution**: No keystrokes, typed text, telemetry, or document data are ever sent over a network.
- All PDF/DOCX/HTML/ZIP export processing occurs strictly in-memory in the client browser.
